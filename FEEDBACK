SPECIFIC FEEDBACK:
Put the reference link in the same slide for images taken on the internet, otherwise, 
indicate that they are licensed to use via "creative commons". 
In Act 1, a jet colormap could be used to emphasize results in the template correlation maps. 

GENERAL FEEDBACK:
I appreciate your dedication to using MATLAB all throughout even though we're staunch Python/colab users. 
I can see your perseverance and you are not shy to ask for help when you need to, 
and that's a good quality that will bring you a long way. 
You're plots are well generated and the reports are presented well. 
Overall, you can consider this GitHub repository as your comprehensive coding portfolio! 
I recommend having the same repository for research purposes so that I can quickly check your codes and files. 
I wish you good luck in your upcoming thesis year, Jonabel. 
I never doubted that you could do it, and you did it well.
Congrats on finishing the course :)
